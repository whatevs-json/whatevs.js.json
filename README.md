FAQ

Q: What is Whatevs?

A: You remember that time when you were working on a product, and the backend
team said "Let's use Mongo!" ? You laughed at them then and told them it was a
bad idea, but they ignored you. Now, three years later, you have 200 MB of data
distributed across three datacenters, each with different consistency settings,
and any given request might respond with data that conforms to a two year old
schema.
You have two choices. If you feel committed to the quality of your product, you
can sigh a deep sigh of resignation. Or, you can shrug, go home, and make a
sand mandala.
That shrug is Whatevs.

Q: Isn't this repo misnamed? It's neither a JS file nor a json file...

A: You seem to have misunderstood the spirit of Whatevs.

Q: I get Whatevs, but what is a "Whatev" (singular)?

A: A Whatev is a random JSON document or fragment of a document.
No two Whatevs are alike, except when they are.
In most cases, a Whatev must be a complete and valid object, but sometimes a
Whatev can be some other JSON data type.
Usually Whatevs are encoded as strings, but maybe not always -- maybe you'll
see the entire blob url escaped. Or maybe it will only be partially escaped. Or
maybe it will URL escape the slashes, but no other special characters, and
include a bunch of non-ASCII characters.
Whatevs, you know?

Usage

I'm looking to make a page for the whatevs site that we can use to stick a
fresh whatev into the header of the whatevs GH pages site.
